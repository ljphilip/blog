### Plus signs on email ids
In your gmail mail id, if you add a '+' sign and any random word after your username, that will still be a valid gmail id and the mails will delivered to the original email address without the '+' sign. For example, if your gmail id is username@gmail.com, if you sign up on Notion, you can provide username+notion@gmail.com as your mail id and the mails will still be delivered to username@gmail.com. This will help in filtering all the emails sent to a specific address and if you start getting spam mails, the habit of appending the servicename to your gmail id will help figure out to an extent which service compromised your mail id.

I knew this was a feature in protonmail and they advertise as such. What was pleasantly surprising for me was that even a free (well) service like gmail supports this feature.

It might be worth checking if your email service provider supports this feature.
